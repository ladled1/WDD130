                    <p>My intention is that this website will be mainly for employers. I want this website to be a site in which I can upload my projects, resume, and also allow visitors to get to know me better. I am thinking of possibly making a QR code that links to this website so that when I go to job fairs, companies would have a quick and easy way to view my resume.</p>
                    <p>I am hoping that my website will help employers understand what skills and certifications I have. I hope to be able to assure any concerns they have by showcasing my projects. I also want them to know who I am as an individual and that I am a person who is easy to work with. My goal is for them to be excited to meet me in person by the time they are done reviewing my website.</p>
